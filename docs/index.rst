hms_irc â€” Extensible IRC microservice
=====================================

How it works
------------

This microservice uses the principle of *receivers* and *commands*. It will
react into the IRC channel using receivers when data arrives from the watched
AMQP topics, and will send data to AMQP topics upon specific user commands.

Here is a concise graph of current *receivers* and *commands* implemented:
