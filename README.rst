AMQP-based microservice for bidirectionnal IRC interactions.

Service responsabilities:

- Deliver information to users on IRC upon AMQP broadcasts on interesting topics
- Verify and help users in building AMQP messages for other microservices
- Allow users and other microservices to communicate using commands/responses

hms_irc is part of the `HAUM Micro-Services (HMS)`_ tools.

Quick start
-----------

Create a Python 3 virtualenv and install software::

    $ virtualenv -ppython3 venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install .

Then start the bot inside the virtualenv::

    (venv) $ hms_irc

You can send arbitrary IRC messages using the provided debug tool::

    (venv) $ hms_irc_debug hello world

How it works
------------

This microservice uses the principle of *receivers* and *commands*. It will
react into the IRC channel using receivers when data arrives from the watched
AMQP topics, and will send data to AMQP topics upon specific user commands.

Here is a concise graph of current *receivers* and *commands* implemented:
